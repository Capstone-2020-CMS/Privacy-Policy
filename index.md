# How the App Works

<b>myBubble</b> utilises three key components of your smartphone to conduct effective contact tracing.

1. <b>Bluetooth</b> is used to record encounters with other smartphone devices with this app installed <i>they <b>must</b> have the app running with <b>Bluetooth</b> enabled as well.</i> Should one user not have <b>Bluetooth</b> enabled then the system breaks down.
        
2. <b>Location Services</b> are used to keep a record of where you have been locally. Note this data is only ever stored locally and is for your personal use so that you do not have to manually log where you have been.
        
3. <b>WIFI/Internet</b>, should you ever come into close contact with someone else using the app that encounter is recorded. Should any of those encounters be confirmed as a COVID case then you will need <b>Internet</b> access to receive a notification informing you.

# Data Sent to the Cloud

The only data sent to the cloud is your random <b>myBubble</b> ID and the date you reported yourself as infected. All other data is stored locally on your device.
